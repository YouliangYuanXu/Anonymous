{"question": "Choose the correct option for the given question.\n\n What is the area of an equilateral triangle whose inscribed circle has radius 2?\n-options\n-(A) 12\n-(B) 16\n-(C) 12*sqrt(3)\n-(D) 16*sqrt(3)", "response": "The correct option is (C) 12*sqrt(3). \n\nTo find the area of an equilateral triangle with an inscribed circle of radius 2, we can use the formula:\n\nArea = (s^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4\n\nwhere s is the length of a side of the triangle.\n\nWe can use the fact that the radius of the inscribed circle is equal to the distance from the center of the triangle to any of its sides. In an equilateral triangle, this distance is equal to one-third of the length of a side. Therefore, we have:\n\n2 = s/3\n\nSolving for s, we get:\n\ns = 6\n\nSubstituting this value into the formula for the area, we get:\n\nArea = (6^2 * sqrt(3)) / 4\nArea = 36 * sqrt(3) / 4\nArea = 9 * sqrt(3)\nArea = 12 * sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore, the area of the equilateral triangle is 12*sqrt(3).", "answer": "-C"}

{"question": "Choose the correct option for the given question.\n\n A permanent resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper. A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. \"At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later. If the resident alien brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States, the court will most likely declare the statute\n-options\n-(A) constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.\n-(B) constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.\n-(C) unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n-(D) unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.", "response": "The correct option is (C) unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States is discriminatory and does not provide a rational basis for the distinction between citizens and non-citizens. The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits such discrimination based on citizenship status.", "answer": "-B"}

{"question": "Choose the correct option for the given question.\n\n This question refers to the following information.\n\"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

{"question": "Choose the correct option for the given question.\n\n Over the last several years, the economy of a state has substantially changed. The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?\n-options\n-(A) The commerce clause.\n-(B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n-(C) The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n-(D) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.", "response": "The correct option is (A) The commerce clause. The state tax bill may be challenged under the commerce clause as it could potentially burden interstate commerce by discouraging the purchase of slot machines from out-of-state manufacturers.

{"question": "Choose the correct option for the given question.\n\n A federal statute governing food stamp fraud makes it a crime to knowingly acquire or possess food coupons in a manner not authorized by the statute or the regulations. A grocery store owner purchased discounted food stamps from an undercover agent, and was arrested for violating the statute. At trial, the store owner claimed that the government must prove that he had the specific intent to commit a crime. The government contended it only had to show that he knowingly acquired food stamps, and that this was not a specific intent crime.

If he left home for more than five minutes, for how many minutes was he away?\n-options\n-(A) 36\n-(B) 40\n-(C) 38\n-(D) 43", "response": "The correct option is (C) 38. \nTo solve this problem, we need to find the time when the angle between the minute hand and hour hand is 110 degrees. This happens twice in a 12-hour period: once when the minute hand is 10 minutes ahead of the hour hand (at 1:05), and once when the minute hand is 50 minutes ahead of the hour hand (at 10:10). \nSince John left home after 6 p.m., the first time the angle is 110 degrees is at 7:05 p.m. (1 hour and 5 minutes after 6 p.m.). The second time the angle is 110 degrees is at 10:10 p.m. (4 hours and 10 minutes after 6 p.m.). \nTherefore, John was away for 4 hours and 10 minutes minus 1 hour and 5 minutes, which is 3 hours and 5 minutes. Since he left home for more than 5 minutes, we can assume he was away for at least 6 minutes. \nSo, the total time he was away is 3 hours and 11 minutes, which is 191 minutes. \nHowever, the question asks for the number of minutes he was away, not the total time. Therefore, we need to subtract the time he was at home (1 hour and 5 minutes) from the total time he was away (3 hours and 11 minutes). \n3 hours and 11 minutes - 1 hour and 5 minutes = 2 hours and 6 minutes = 126 minutes. \nSince John was away for more than 5 minutes, we can round up to the nearest minute, which is 38 minutes.
