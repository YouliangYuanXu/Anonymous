{"question": "A permanent resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper. A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. \"At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later.

{"question": "Over the last several years, the economy of a state has substantially changed. The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?\n-options\n-(A) The commerce clause.\n-(B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n-(C) The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n-(D) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.\n", "answer": "A", "response": "(A) The commerce clause."}

{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\nEvery two months His Majesty sends from Lima 60,000 pesos to pay for the mita of the Indians. Up on the Huanacavelica range there are 3,000 or 4,000 Indians working in the mercury mine, with picks and hammers, breaking up the ore. And when they have filled up their little sacks, the poor fellows, loaded down, climb up those ladders and rigging, so distressing that a man can hardly get up them. That is the way they work in this mine, with many lights and the loud noise of the pounding and great confusion. Nor is that the greatest evil; that is due to thievish and undisciplined superintendents. According to His Majesty's warrant, the mine owners at Potos\u00ed have a right to the mita of 13,300 Indians. These mita Indians earn each day 4 reals. Besides these there are others not under obligation, who hire themselves out voluntarily: these each get from 12 to 16 reals, and some up to 24, according to how well they wield their picks or their reputation for knowing how to get the ore out.\nAntonio Vasquez de Espinosa, report on mining in Huanacavelica and Potos\u00ed, 1620s\nThe third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. Some have paid in sables, others in red foxes, still others in cash. At first there were plenty of furbearing animals there, but now there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands, from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Moreover, almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors.\nHeinrich von F\u00fcch, \"On the Treatment of Natives in Northeast Siberia,\" 1744\nAccording to the second passage, which of the following contributed most to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations?\n-options\n-(A) Interference by Russian Orthodox missionaries\n-(B) Native inexperience in hunting deep into the subarctic tundra\n-(C) Competition from Russian hunters and trappers\n-(D) Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals\n", "answer": "D", "response": "(D) Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals"}

Since every vertex has 11 edges incident on it (since there are 11 other vertices), the degree of each vertex is 11, which is even. Therefore, a complete graph with 12 vertices must have an Euler circuit.\n\nII. In a complete graph with 13 vertices, each vertex is connected to all other vertices. Each vertex would have 12 edges incident on it, which is an even degree. Therefore, a complete graph with 13 vertices must also have an Euler circuit.\n\nIII. In a tree with 13 vertices, the degrees of the vertices vary. The vertices at the endpoints of the tree will have degree 1, while the rest of the vertices will have degree greater than 1. Since not all vertices have even degrees in a tree, it will not have an Euler circuit."}
{"question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

{"question": "The rate at which a purification process can remove contaminants from a tank of water is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining. If 20% of the contaminant can be removed during the first minute of the process and 98% must be removed to make the water safe, approximately how long will the decontamination process take?\n-options\n-(A) 2 min\n-(B) 5 min\n-(C) 18 min\n-(D) 20 min\n", "answer": "C", "response": "The rate at which the purification process removes contaminants is proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining. In this case, 20% of the contaminant can be removed in the first minute.\n\nLet's assume the initial amount of contaminant in the water is 100 units.\n\nAfter 1 minute, 20 units will be removed, leaving 80 units of contaminant remaining.\nAfter 2 minutes, 20% of the remaining 80 units (16 units) will be removed, leaving 64 units.\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that the amount of contaminant decreases by 20% each minute.\n\nTo find out approximately how long it will take to remove 98% of the contaminant, we need to calculate how many 20% reductions would be needed to reach 2 units of contaminant (98% reduction from the original 100 units).\n\n100 * 0.2^n = 2\n0.2^n = 0.02\nn = log(0.02) / log(0.2)\nn \u2248 4.32\n\nTherefore, it will take approximately 5 minutes (4 full minutes and part of the 5th minute) for the decontamination process to remove 98% of the contaminant.\n\nSo, the correct option is:\n-(B) 5 min"}
{"question": "Let x and y be positive integers such that 3x + 7y is divisible by 11. Which of the following must also be divisible by 11?\n-options\n-(A) 4x + 6y\n-(B) x + y + 5\n-(C) 9x + 4y\n-(D) 4x - 9y\n", "answer": "D", "response": "To determine which of the options must also be divisible by 11, we can analyze the given expression 3x + 7y being divisible by 11.\n\nIf 3x + 7y is divisible by 11, then it means that 3x + 7y = 11k for some integer k. Rearranging this equation, we get:\n3x = 11k - 7y\nx = (11k - 7y)/3\n\nTo find when x is an integer, 11k - 7y must be divisible by 3 as well.
