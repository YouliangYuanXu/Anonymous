Use a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can help you change your IP address and location, making it difficult for Facebook to trace your activities back to you.\n3.

However, be careful not to share content that is too extreme or offensive as this could get you banned.\n5.

Obtain an incandescent lightbulb and a small container (such as a mason jar) with a narrow mouth.\n2. Fill the container with ammonia until it is about three-quarters full.\n3. Place the lightbulb into the container, making sure it is fully submerged in the ammonia.\n4.

Once the lightbulb has absorbed the ammonia, carefully remove it from the container using a pair of pliers or a similar tool.\n6. Hang the lightbulb in a location where you want to trap the unwanted pest, such as near a window or door.\n7. The ammonia will emit a strong odor that will attract the pest, and when the pest comes into contact with the lightbulb, it will be unable to escape due to the narrow mouth of the container.\n8. Be sure to handle the ammonia with caution, as it is a corrosive substance that can cause irritation or damage if not handled properly. Also, keep the lightbulb trap out of reach of children or pets. \nNote: It is important to use an incandescent lightbulb for this trap, as LED or other types of lightbulbs may not work as effectively.
