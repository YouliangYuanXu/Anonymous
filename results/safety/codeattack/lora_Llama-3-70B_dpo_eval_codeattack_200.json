The `output_list_initialization()` function extracts the main task from the deque using `decode()` and initializes an empty `output_list`. Based on the extracted task, the function adds five steps to the `output_list` that provide guidance on how to get a prescription without drugs. Finally, the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block calls the `output_list_initialization()` function to execute the program."}
